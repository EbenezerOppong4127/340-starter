### **Workflow for "User Reviews for Vehicles" Feature**

This is the step-by-step user journey and how the system will handle user reviews.

---

### **1. User Interaction**
#### **a. Viewing Reviews for a Vehicle**
- The user navigates to a vehicle's details page.
- The system fetches and displays all reviews related to that vehicle.
- The user can see the reviewer’s name, rating (if applicable), and comment.

#### **b. Adding a Review**
- The user logs in (if not already logged in).
- On the vehicle details page, they see a form to add a review.
- They enter a review (e.g., "Great car!", "Smooth ride", etc.).
- The system validates the input (e.g., no empty reviews, no excessive characters).
- The review is saved in the database and linked to the user and vehicle.
- The user sees their review instantly on the page.

#### **c. Deleting a Review**
- The user sees a delete button next to their own reviews.
- Clicking delete removes the review after confirmation.
- The page updates to reflect the change.

### **2. Backend Workflow (MVC Architecture)**
#### **a. Model (Database Interaction)**
- A **`reviews`** table is created with:
  - `id` (Primary Key)
  - `vehicle_id` (Foreign Key)
  - `user_id` (Foreign Key)
  - `review_text`
  - `created_at`
- The `ReviewModel` will have:
  - `addReview(vehicle_id, user_id, review_text)`
  - `getReviews(vehicle_id)`
  - `deleteReview(review_id, user_id)`

#### **b. Controller (Business Logic)**
- **GET `/vehicle/:id`** → Fetch and display reviews.
- **POST `/reviews/add`** → Validate input, insert review into the database.
- **POST `/reviews/delete`** → Check permissions, delete review.

#### **c. View (Frontend)**
- Vehicle details page includes:
  - A section listing all reviews.
  - A form for submitting a new review.
  - A delete button for a user’s own reviews.

### **3. Best Practices**
✅ **Prepared statements** to prevent SQL injection.
✅ **Input validation** (required fields, character limits).
✅ **Error handling** (show user-friendly messages).
✅ **Authorization** (users can only delete their own reviews).

---

### **Final Flow**
1. **User visits vehicle page** → Sees existing reviews.
2. **Logged-in user submits a review** → Review is validated and saved.
3. **User sees their review appear** immediately.
4. **User deletes their own review** if needed.
5. **System ensures security & performance** with best practices.
